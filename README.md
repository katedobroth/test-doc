# documentation

Source files for publicly available Cazena documentation that is deployed at docs.cazena.com.

The project uses Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) to compile Markdown, CSS, etc into a static site. The static site is in the _site directory. This directory is then copied over to the cazenaweb repository (owned by Hannah's web contractor), which is then deployed on Acquia.
