## Cazena's Fully-Managed Big Data as a Service 

Cazena is a Fully-Managed Big Data as a Service that enables enterprises to securely migrate, store and analyze their data in the cloud. Cazena manages the creation, configuration, security setup, and management of cloud infrastructure to create a single-tenant datacloud. Cazena then continually monitors and manages this platform ensuring that it is secure and optimized for your current set of workloads.

Cazena's two flagship solutions are:

* [Data Lake as a Service](https://www.cazena.com/solutions/data-lake)


* [Data Science Sandbox as a Service](https://www.cazena.com/solutions/data-science)

There is more information about other solutions in the [Solutions Gallery](https://www.cazena.com/solutions) on Cazena's website.

Each solution included the following components, in addition to data engines and cloud storage:

* __Cazena Gateways__ provide a secure connection between the enterprise and the Cazena private datacloud (PDC). The gateway allows data to be moved securely into the datacloud, and also provides secure access for BI and analytics tools.

* __Cloud Sockets__ expose Cazena services on your local network, providing access to web interfaces  and APIs. On-premises analytics and BI tools connect to the Cazena datacloud via cloud sockets.

* The __AppCloud__ allows you to deploy any tool (e.g., analytics, machine learning, or proprietary algorithms), with secure access to data in the cloud.


This documentation covers tasks that can be done from the Cazena web console. These tasks are listed in the table of contents navigation on the left side of this screen.
