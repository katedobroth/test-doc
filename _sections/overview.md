Cazena's Fully-Managed Big Data as a Service solution is a secure environment that helps enterprises to move and process data in the cloud. Cazena manages the creation, configuration, security setup, and management of cloud infrastructure to create a single-tenant datacloud. Cazena then continually monitors and manages this platform ensuring that it is secure and optimized for your current set of workloads.

Cazena offers three solutions:

* [Data Lake as a Service](https://www.cazena.com/solutions/data-lake)

* [Data Mart as a Service](https://www.cazena.com/solutions/data-mart)

* [Data Science Sandbox as a Service](https://www.cazena.com/solutions/data-science)

Each solution included the following components, in addition to data engines and cloud storage:

* __Cazena Gateways__ provide a secure connection between the enterprise and the Cazena private datacloud (PDC). The gateway allows data to be moved securely into the datacloud, and also provides secure access for BI and analytics tools.

* __Cloud Sockets__ expose Cazena services on your local network, providing access to web interfaces  and APIs. On-premises analytics and BI tools connect to the Cazena datacloud via cloud sockets.

* The __AppCloud__ allows you to deploy any tool (e.g., analytics, machine learning, or proprietary algorithms), with secure access to data in the cloud.
